# Lights Controller
Lights controller has been complete designed for controlling 4 RGB LED raws, in order to provide a better ground-air visualization  with our drone and know at real time what the drone is doing inside its hardware
# Hardware
Hardware consist of a PCB designed in easyeda, 12 transistors **2N2222** , 12 resistors **2k** and **arduino nano** which works as the semi-endebbed microcontroller
# Software
The purpose of the controller mainly is to control with PWM signal the bright of led as well as create a code of colors which allow to controllers to verify what the drone is really doing on air. Programmed in Arduino (C++) the code drives the beheviaour of the lights
